# Autonomous Flight

Autonomous flight contains 5 test files and a launch file for ROS Noetic/Gazebo.

The launch file can be edited to launch the 5 test files.

These test files can be sequentially used to test the different autonomous flight functionalities.


# Motor control

The motor control files can be used to control the motor wirelessly using MQTT/Mosquitto. This requires two raspberry pis running linux (4B+ was used).



RPi 1 (connected to the motor driver board/motor):

BSS_master.py can be ran using (sudo must be used) in terminal:

``` sudo python3 bss_master.py ```

This will call the other python files.

This RPi will then continue monitoring the "EFS/target_pos" MQTT topic. 



RPi 2 (on UAV or near the system):

Transmit a signal to move the motor in terminal:

``` mosquitto_pub -t "EFS/target_pos" -m 5

Where 5 is the target position.
